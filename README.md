# Company-Api-Django
Description:

This Django application provides a RESTful API for managing company data. It allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete company information through secure HTTP requests.

Features:

    CRUD operations for companies:
        Create new companies
        Retrieve existing companies (individually or all)
        Update company details
        Delete companies
    Customizable data model: Easily extend the model to include additional company-specific fields.
    Authentication and authorization: Implement authentication mechanisms to control access to API endpoints (consider using Django REST Framework's built-in or custom authentication).
    Serializers: Utilize Django REST Framework serializers for data validation and conversion between Python objects and JSON representations.
    Permissions: Define granular permissions to restrict access to API operations based on user roles (consider using Django Object Permissions or custom permissions).
    Documentation: Provide clear API documentation using tools like Django REST Framework's browsable API or Swagger.
    Testing: Ensure code quality with unit and integration tests.

Example Usage (using Postman):

    Create a new company:
        Set the request method to POST.
        Set the URL to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/companies/.
        In the request body (raw or JSON), provide company data (e.g., name, address, website).
        Send the request.

    Retrieve all companies:
        Set the request method to GET.
        Set the URL to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/companies/.
        Send the request. This will return a list of companies in JSON format.
