# Company-And-Employee-Api-Django

Description:

This enhanced Django application offers a robust RESTful API for managing company and employee data. It facilitates secure HTTP requests for CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations on both companies and their associated employees.

Key Features:

    Comprehensive CRUD Functionality:
        Create new companies and employees.
        Retrieve individual or all companies and employees.
        Update company and employee details.
        Delete companies and employees (with appropriate safeguards).
    Flexible Data Models:
        Effortlessly expand the models to incorporate additional company-specific fields.
        Tailor employee models to capture relevant information (e.g., name, position, department, contact details).
    Robust Authentication and Authorization:
        Employ Django REST Framework's built-in or custom authentication to ensure secure access.
        Implement granular permissions (using Object Permissions or custom mechanisms) to control API endpoint access based on user roles.
    Streamlined Data Serialization:
        Leverage Django REST Framework serializers for efficient data validation and conversion between Python objects and JSON representations.
    Detailed API Documentation:
        Provide clear and comprehensive API documentation using tools like Django REST Framework's browsable API or Swagger. This empowers developers to readily understand and utilize the endpoints effectively.
    Thorough Testing:
        Maintain code quality and reliability through a combination of unit and integration tests.
    Employee Management:
        Seamlessly manage employee data within the company context.
        Access detailed employee information for each company.
        Perform CRUD operations on employees, aligning with company-specific requirements.

Example Usage (using Postman):

Company API:

    Create a new company:
        Set the request method to POST.
        Set the URL to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/companies/.
        Include company data (e.g., name, address, website) in the JSON request body.
        Send the request to create the company.
    Retrieve all companies:
        Set the request method to GET.
        Set the URL to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api//v1companies/.
        Send the request to retrieve a list of companies in JSON format.

Employee API:

    Create a new employee for a specific company:
        Set the request method to POST.
        Set the URL to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/companies/<company_id>/employees/. (Replace <company_id> with the actual company ID).
        Include employee data (e.g., name, position, department, contact details) in the JSON request body.
        Send the request to create the employee associated with that company.
    Retrieve all employees of a company:
        Set the request method to GET.
        Set the URL to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/companies/<company_id>/employees/. (Replace <company_id> with the actual company ID).
        Send the request to retrieve a list of employees belonging to that company in JSON format.
